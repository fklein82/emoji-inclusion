# INCLUSION APP

To deploy this demo app you need to have VMware Tanzu Application Platform with full profile installed.
VMware Tanzu Application Platform is a modular, application-aware platform that provides a rich set of developer tooling and a prepaved path to production to build and deploy software quickly and securely on any compliant public cloud or on-premises Kubernetes cluster.

The first release of this application stores emojis in an in-memory database and displays an emoji only as it is not stateful and data are ephemeral.

The final release of this application stores data in a postgres database and can display a collection of emojis, as data are persistent.
